            If you're looking for easily accessible resources for your classroom,
            then you're in the right place. Online learning with the Android app
            is very easy to access. That's why we've hand-curated the School Aura
            free app and website. Easy to use and learn!
          </p>
          <p>
            To learn online, you need to be reasonably comfortable with Smart
            Mobile Phone, Tab, Laptops, and the internet. The advantage of learning
            online via an android app is that you can pause the video/audio whenever
            you need to take notes or simply absorb what has been said. Another
            fantastic feature of online learning is that you can re-listen to
            different parts as needed, which is something you can't do in a live
            lecture!
